# Learning Highlights
## 🖥️ Implementing the Serializable Interface
The Serializable interface is used to allow objects to be converted into a format that can be easily stored and transmitted.

## 💻 Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
DTOs are used to transfer data between processes. They help encapsulate data and can be used to simplify the API interface and improve performance.

## 👩‍💻 Query with @Query Annotation
The @Query annotation allows the execution of custom queries in MongoDB. It enables creating complex queries in a simple and efficient way.
